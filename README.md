# Coloring game

A simple coloring game using kineticjs.


## Environment installation

To build the site you need:

- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
- [Bower](http://bower.io)


To setup the build environment, clone the repository and then in the working directory run: `npm install` to install any node modules required by gulp and `bower install` to install any bower dependencies required by bower.

Workfiles are located in `src` folder.

You can then run `gulp` to build and serve the website on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
